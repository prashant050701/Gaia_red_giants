The aim of this repository will be to build a database of red giants in the solar neighborhood, potentially observable in planet searches.
This database will set a scene on which current planet searches are done.
Statistical properties of the red giant population observed by Gaia will be used to estimate the occurrence rate of evolved planetary systems at various areas of the Red Giant Branch.
